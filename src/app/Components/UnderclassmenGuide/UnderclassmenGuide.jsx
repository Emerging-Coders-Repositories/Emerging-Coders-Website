                                    The purposes of this guide is to provide additional context and guidance when it comes to navigating the Computer Science major at Northwestern. The department already provides lots of resources, guides, and opportunities for students to succeed, but we wanted to provide a more personal and condensed guide that is based on the experiences of our members and alumni.
                                    This guide by no means is perfect to every situation, interest, or path that you may embark on during your time at Northwestern but, if you someone that is completely new to Computer Science (like many of us were), or you don't have someone to ask questions to, we hope that this guide can help you out with answering some of your questions. Keep in mind also that this guide is mostly geared for those wanting to enter <strong>industry</strong> after graduation. A more detailed version for folks interested in graduate school will be coming soon!

                                        In simple terms, Computer science is like a magical world of instructions and thinking for computers. It's all about teaching computers how to do cool stuff. Just like you learn math and languages in school, computer scientists learn how to talk to computers. 
                                        Imagine you have a really smart robot friend, and you want to tell it what to do. Computer science helps you do that. You can tell the robot to play your favorite game, draw pictures, solve math problems, or even talk to your friends on the internet.
                                        <br/>
                                        <br/>
                                        Here are some important things in computer science:
                                    </p>
                                    <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
                                        <li><strong>Coding: </strong> This is like giving instructions to your robot friend. You use special languages (like C, Python, or JavaScript) to write these instructions. It's like creating a recipe for the robot to follow.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Algorithms: </strong>Think of this as a plan or a recipe for your robot. It's a step-by-step guide on how to solve a problem, like finding the best way to get from your house to the park.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Data: </strong>This is like information that the robot needs to remember. It could be your favorite game scores, your friends' names, or anything else. Computer scientists figure out how to store and use this data.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Hardware: </strong> These are the physical parts of a computer, like the screen, keyboard, and memory. Computer scientists design and build these parts to make computers work.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Software: </strong>This is like the apps and programs you use on your computer or tablet. Computer scientists create software to do all kinds of fun and useful things.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <br />
                                    Computer science is like a big playground where you can create, explore, and solve puzzles with computers. It's not just about playing games but also about making the world a better place by solving real-world problems. So, if you're curious and love to learn, computer science can be a fantastic adventure for you!

                                        Pursuing a degree in computer science offers not only promising career prospects but also the chance to make a meaningful impact on the world through innovation and problem-solving. It's a field that rewards curiosity, adaptability, and a passion for learning.
                                        A Computer Science is very versatile and the skills that you learn in a CS degree can be applied to a wide variety of fields and industries. You don't have to become a software engineer after graduation, you can become a data scientist, a product manager, a UX designer, a technical writer, a technical recruiter, and so much more!
