                1. Ask Questions
                </h5>
                <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 mb-5">
                Asking questions is one of the most important things that you can do during a technical interview. It shows that you are engaged and interested in the problem that you are solving. It also shows that you are able to think critically and ask the right questions to get the information that you need to solve the problem.
                It's important to ask questions throughout the interview to make sure that you are on the right track and that you are solving the problem correctly. It's also important to ask questions to clarify any ambiguities in the problem statement.
                <strong> do not</strong> make assumptions about the problem statement. If you are unsure about something, ask the interviewer.

                </h5>
                <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 mb-5">
                It's important to communicate your thought process and what you are thinking to your interviewer. The emphasis of the technical interview is <strong>not always </strong> going to be on solving the problem. 
                It's vital that during the interview you are constantly communicating your though process and problem solving over anything else. This is because the interviewer wants to see how you think and how you approach problems.
                If you are are able to communicate well, <strong>you can actually get better help to solve the problem</strong>.

                <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 mb-5">
                It's important to listen to your interviewer and to their suggestions. They are there to help you and want you to succeed. If they are giving you suggestions, it's because they want you to succeed and want to help you out. 
                It's also important to listen to your interviewer because they may give you hints or tips that can help you solve the problem.

                </h5>
                <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 mb-5">
                If you don’t know the answer, take a few minutes to think about it. Say that you have not encountered a similar scenario, but you are going to try to work through a process to solve the problem. Think out loud, ask for some direction.
                <strong> If you're really stuck</strong>, you can as to go through examples of the problem. This will help you understand the problem better and will help you come up with a solution.

                <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 mb-5">
                It's okay if you don't immediately see the most optimal solution to the problem, you can always start out with a brute force solution to the problem and then optimize it later.

                For most interviews, business professional attire is expected. This is true for many engineering and technology firms. But there are exceptions, particularly in the startup/tech space, some west coast firms, and for some software focused roles. Please dress according to pre-interview guidelines provided by the company. If in doubt, ask the recruiter.
