        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 mb-10">
          In the fast-paced world of software engineering, technical interviews
          play a crucial role in assessing a candidate's skills and suitability
          for a role. These interviews are designed to evaluate not just your
          coding abilities but also your problem-solving skills, algorithmic
          thinking, and, in some cases, your ability to design scalable systems.
