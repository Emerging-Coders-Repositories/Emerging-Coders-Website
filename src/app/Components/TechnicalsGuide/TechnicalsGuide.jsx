                      of course, in the grand scheme of things, this may not seem like a long time but i just wanted to say real quick that this has one of the best months that I‚Äôve had in a while. Since the first day we met i knew from the bottom of my heart that what we could have together would be real. i geniuely feel like i can be myself around you and that you truly accept me for who i am. when i am around you, it's like nothing else matters. i just want to focus on you and being present. 

                      i love the adventures that we go on. i love how you get me to explore and take part in my passions and interest again. i love how supportive we are of each other's work. it's those small things that me feel like we are going to be together for a long time. 

                      of course, this is just the beginning and i am excited to see where this goes. i am excited to see how we grow together and how we can continue to support each other. everyday i look forward to talking to you and seeing you. i am exicted to see you to continue to grow and pursue your dreams and passions, i'll always be here to support you. 

                      again, happy one-month annivesary brianna <333 im so grateful and lucky to have you in my life.
