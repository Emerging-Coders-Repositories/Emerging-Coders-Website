          <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
            Technical interviews come in various forms, each serving a specific purpose in evaluating a candidate's capabilities. Here are some common types:
          </p>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6">
            <li>
              <strong>Coding Interviews:</strong> In coding interviews, you'll be asked to solve programming challenges on a whiteboard, a shared online code editor, or on paper. These challenges test your ability to write clean, efficient, and bug-free code. Common topics include data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>System Design Interviews:</strong> System design interviews focus on your ability to architect complex software systems. You'll be asked to design a scalable, reliable, and efficient system based on real-world scenarios. This type of interview assesses your knowledge of system architecture, database design, and scalability.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Behavioral Interviews:</strong> Behavioral interviews evaluate your soft skills and assess your ability to work effectively within a team. You may be asked about your past experiences, how you handle challenges, and how you collaborate with colleagues.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Take-Home Projects:</strong> Some companies may ask you to complete a coding project at home and submit it within a specified timeframe. Take-home projects allow you to showcase your coding skills and problem-solving abilities in a more relaxed environment.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
            These are just a few examples of the types of technical interviews you may encounter. It's essential to understand the specific requirements of the job you're applying for to prepare effectively.
