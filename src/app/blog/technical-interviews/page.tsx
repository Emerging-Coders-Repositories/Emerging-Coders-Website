            Introduction to Technical Interviews
          </h2>
          <p className="text-zinc-400 mb-6">
            In the fast-paced world of software engineering, technical
            interviews play a crucial role in assessing a candidate's skills and
            suitability for a role. These interviews are designed to evaluate
            not just your coding abilities but also your problem-solving skills,
            algorithmic thinking, and, in some cases, your ability to design
            scalable systems.

              Choosing a Programming Language
            </h3>
            <p className="text-zinc-400 mb-4">
              The first step in preparing for technical interviews is to choose
              a programming language to study with. Generally, your interviewers
              will allow you to choose between popular coding languages such as
              Python, C, C++, and JavaScript. While you could technically do
              your technical interviews in a language such as Racket, it is not
              recommended as it is not a popular language and is not used in
              industry. Unless you are interviewing for a more specific role
              such as a mobile app developer or a front-end developer position,
              you should be able to have free reign over the coding language
              that you do your interviews in.
            </p>
            <p className="text-zinc-400 mb-4">
              Ideally, you should choose a programming language that you already
              have some experience with or at least used in one of your classes.
              This will allow you to focus more on studying the problem-solving
              aspects of the technical interview more than the syntax of the
              language. However, if you are not familiar with any of the popular
              programming languages, it is recommended that you choose a
              language that is easy to learn and has a lot of resources
              available online such as Python.
            </p>
            <p className="text-zinc-400 mb-4">
              Our recommendation based on what we've seen and used ourselves, is
              to use a language such as Python or JavaScript. This is due to the
              fact that these languages are easy to learn and have a lot of
              resources available online. Additionally, they already have a lot
              of built-in functions, data structures, and libraries that you can
              use to solve problems. This makes your job during the interview a
              lot easier as you don't have to worry about implementing these
              things yourself. Thus, giving you more time to focus on the
              problem-solving aspect of the interview.

            <p className="text-zinc-400 mb-6">
              Nowadays, there are a lot of resources that exist on the internet
              that can help you prepare for technical interviews. These
              resources can range from books, to online courses, to practice
              problems, and more. Unfortunately, some resources are mostly just
              trying to make money off of you and don't offer anything useful
              behind their paywalls. So, we've compiled a list of resources and
              tools that we've used in our studying and preparation that we felt
              were the most helpful while accommodating various learning styles!

                NeetCode is very similar to LeetCode in that it provides a large

                provides a list of curated problems that are organized by topic

              Mock Interviews

            <p className="text-zinc-400 mb-4">
              Mock interviews are arguably the best and most efficient way to
              prepare for technical interviews. Mock interviews are essentially
              practice interviews that you do with someone else such as a
              friend, an upperclassman, or your roommate. The purpose of mock
              interviews is to simulate the experience of a real technical
              interview. This allows you to get a feel for what a real technical
              interview is like and allows you to practice your problem-solving
              skills in a more realistic environment.

            <p className="text-zinc-400 mb-4">
              The best thing about doing mock interviews is that you are able to
              gain insights into your strengths and weaknesses. This allows you
              to focus on improving your weaknesses and building on your
              strengths. You can also become comfortable with having to solve
              technical problems in a time crunch and pressure. Overall, it is{" "}

            <p className="text-zinc-400 mb-4">
              Asking questions is one of the most important things that you can
              do during a technical interview. It shows that you are engaged and
              interested in the problem that you are solving. It also shows that
              you are able to think critically and ask the right questions to
              get the information that you need to solve the problem. It's
              important to ask questions throughout the interview to make sure
              that you are on the right track and that you are solving the
              problem correctly. It's also important to ask questions to clarify
              any ambiguities in the problem statement.
              <strong> Do not</strong> make assumptions about the problem
              statement. If you are unsure about something, ask the interviewer.

            <p className="text-zinc-400 mb-4">
              It's important to communicate your thought process and what you

              the problem. It's vital that during the interview you are
              constantly communicating your thought process and problem solving
              over anything else. This is because the interviewer wants to see

              If you don't know the answer, take a few minutes to think about
              it. Say that you have not encountered a similar scenario, but you
              are going to try to work through a process to solve the problem.
              Think out loud, ask for some direction.
              <strong> If you're really stuck</strong>, you can ask to go
              through examples of the problem. This will help you understand the
              problem better and will help you come up with a solution.

              It's okay if you don't immediately see the most optimal solution
              to the problem, you can always start out with a brute force
              solution to the problem and then optimize it later.

            <p className="text-zinc-400 mb-4">
              For most interviews, business professional attire is expected.
              This is true for many engineering and technology firms. But there
              are exceptions, particularly in the startup/tech space, some west
              coast firms, and for some software focused roles. Please dress
              according to pre-interview guidelines provided by the company. If
              in doubt, ask the recruiter.

            <p className="text-zinc-400 mb-4">
              Being on time is crucial. It shows that you are punctual and
              reliable. It also shows that you are respectful of the
              interviewer's time. If you are running late, make sure to let the
              interviewer know as soon as possible.
